# FRET Macrofication Project

The project's aim is to find repeating patterns in NASA's FRET requirements and construct macros that would lead to a simpler and more efficient system.

Run the main.py script by passing it the .json file of requirements you need to serialise.

Example run from fret-macrofication\FRET\src: `python3 .\main.py ..\data\fret_data\raw\UseCase6.json`
